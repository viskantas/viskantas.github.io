What a fantastic book. Though, I struggle to say I “enjoyed” it because it was so depressing!

Cormac does an excellent job bringing you straight to this post-apocalyptic world. The first few pages and you already have a perfect sense of the location - a grey, lifeless world. There’s no hope here, just death and suffering.

Father and son are the main characters of the book. They are always on a journey, and it’s a struggle. Not only for them but also for the reader as it’s so easy to feel sorry for them. The emotional punches are strong in this book. I don’t think I smiled once in this story, I only remember plenty of eyewatering moments. 

You really wish for a happy ending, but from the beginning, you doubt there can be one. The first few chapters already make it clear there’s no hope in this world. Can anyone be happy to be on this dying planet? Maybe the only happy ending could be a quick death for both characters…

As you are reading this book you start losing hope in humanity. You doubt any goodness can be left in these dreadful conditions. Try trusting anyone and you will get robbed and will probably die of hunger. Actually, that would be a reasonably good outcome because torture and cannibalism happen quite often in these lands. Even with all of this madness the boy still believes there’s some goodness left. He believes there are good people around. As a reader, you can only hope his naivety doesn’t bring him terror.

Pick this book up. You will get sucked into this story. You will deeply care for the characters. But at the same time, you’ve been warned. There’s no joy in here.
