You are a software engineer. You recently joined a startup. Suddenly your manager forces you to do web designs because the team doesn’t have a designer, and you have no idea how to do it! This is a survival guide on how to do web designs for a complete noob.

**Step 0.** Your designs will suck - come to terms with it. Most software engineers have no taste in design, and you are likely to be one of them. You don’t need to worry too much about it, your colleagues know you are no designer. Realize early whatever you will design, it will be very far from being perfect. Hopefully, this will make you less protective of your designs and more willing to get feedback.

**Step 1.** Pick Figma (or whatever is popular today). Don’t use Paint! Just google whatever is the most popular web design tool today, and use that. Don’t try to be fancy finding niche tools. What’s popular is likely to be easy to learn. Now learn that tool, you will know how to use it in a couple of hours. Web design tools are actually not that difficult.

**Step 2.** Skip low-fidelity designs. Why? Because you can’t do it properly. Yes, a good web designer knows how to use them. Low-fidelity helps to design a good User Experience. But unless in your previous life, you have been a designer and have skills for it, just skip it. For you it will be easier to immediately see how the web app will look like.

**Step 3.** Copy and keep things simple. Don’t “over-design”. Avoid smart solutions. Look around for examples what already works and what other web apps use. Don’t pretend you are a good designer and that you can think out of the box. Small tip: when googling for design examples, use “ux” term in search - it will bring you more modern examples.

**Step 4.** Get feedback from your colleagues. Show your designs in private meetings, sprint demos, slack channels, etc. Whatever works for you. It’s likely there will be people around with better design taste, so copy their ideas!

**Step 5.** Let your customers try it. After building the designed solution (a prototype, or a fully working feature), have a meeting with your customer. During the meeting observe how the user uses your solution. Get their feedback. Is the customer struggling to use your solution? Is not everything clear? Time to go back to the drawing board - whatever you designed lacks good UX, so find ways to improve it. And after fixing it, continue getting further feedback. I know, developers hate talking with their customers, but this step is crucial if you want to have a great app!

**Step 6.** Read “How to Win Friends and Influence People" to gain skills for talking your manager into hiring an actual designer. Because let’s be honest, you hated all of this and just want to go back to coding.

**Step 7.** You failed to talk you manager into hiring a designer, so you have to improve your design skills. Read “Refactoring UI”. It’s a great design book for dummies. Find more resources. You are doomed to do further design work, so you will have to invest in your skills.

This is based on personal experience, this is how I survived doing design work. I’m not pretending I did a great job, but the designs were “good enough” to keep the product moving forward and get customers. If I managed to do it, you can do it as well. Well, at least until your manager finally hires that designer.
